                    <p>TEDxNTHU is the official representative of TED in Hsinchu. As a member of the Academic Department, I was responsible for inviting diverse speakers from various industries to share their experiences.

                    <p>Driven by my passion for popping, I joined the NTHU Pop Dance Club in 2018. During dance practices, I learned the importance of teamwork and collaboration to ensure our group performances were sharp and cohesive. I also discovered that I serve as a catalyst for the team, helping to uplift the atmosphere and boost morale. Being part of the Pop Dance Club feels like being part of a big family, and the experience of dancing together with everyone has been truly incredible.</p>

                    <p>As an Algorithmic Trader at the Rotman Trading Competition 2024, I leveraged my quantitative skills and strategic thinking to design and implement trading algorithms tailored for various market conditions. Collaborating with my team, I developed strategies that optimized trade execution and managed risk efficiently across multiple asset classes. The competition provided a dynamic environment to apply advanced concepts in algorithmic trading, including real-time data analysis, market impact modeling, and order flow management. This experience further honed my ability to quickly adapt to market fluctuations and deliver strong results in a competitive setting.</p>
